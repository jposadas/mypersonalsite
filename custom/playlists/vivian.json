This song also marks the end of awesome times I had with you during the winter, right before leaving for Spain. I never knew that moment at the airport would be the end of incredibly awesome times with you. I wish that moment had lasted forever, and this song goes with all that for me.",

Playing on your guitar in your room while Britttttttaaa was gone and finding the right capo number, guessing the wrong lyrics with you. One of those moments in the summer when I felt what I felt in the winter. Maybe my mistake was to try to always compare everything to the winter, and not to make this new time its own thing.
