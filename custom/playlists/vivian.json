And then I told you about this song, and how I wanted to learn it, and you said: 'Let's do it!'. Great times nonetheless.",

Besides never being able to say: 'Well I got down on my kneeeess!' properly, and always laughing at 'Stepped into a church'. Haha! I can't deal. Awesome times :) Which brings me to that FB message to come jam to my house some February monday evening after KFC. Best decision of my life, though I wasn't trying on purpose! But we just ended up just watching Wie ich deine Mutter kennenlernte! or something like that, and talking. One of those nights when time didn't matter and we could stay up all night just talking.",

Aber... one of those songs that just makes me happy :) And thanks for putting up with me singing this non stop at some point! This was also during our SlappyBitch/Flappyfisch/SloppyFish days. I will never forget that moment when you were so excited to try EXTREME mode, and you hit START, and died in less than a second because the fish just went down. And.. this was on that 249 on the way to my house after the Wannsee and dinner with Jordan at Viet Thai Box around 9pm, and you came up with the excuse to pick up your bike, and I invited you in for some tea :) Damn, that memory though.

Loved it when we attempted to harmonize the 'I've got soul but I'm not a solier' part. So many laughs and fails! I think we were playing this when we got our 50 cents from that dude at Spichernstra√üe! You were so cool about just playing wherever, and I was so nervous of fucking up",

It's that song that whenever or wherever I listen to it, there is only one person and one person only that comes to mind, and that person is ... yeah, that person is YOU! This song also marks the end of awesome times I had with you during the winter, right before leaving for Spain. I never knew that moment at the airport would be the end of one of the most amazing 4 weeks with someone so special like you. I wish that moment had lasted forever, and this song goes with all that for me.",

This was a non stop song for me for a couple of days, and I remember a moment when I was like: 'Can we please play it just one more time! Please!'. For some odd reason, when I listen to it, I picture you biking around some beach in LA and being free and happy. Don't know why. Is it somewhat true?",

Hope I can make a real trip down there and explore everything. But nothing beats my Monterrey secret beach. Monterrey Mexico or Monterrey California though? :) ",

Maybe the lyrics are ambiguous, but in an odd interpretation that I give it, it all makes sense. The music calms me down whenever I'm anxious, and it's one of those songs that also reminds me of you. Playing your guitar in your room while Britttttttaaa was gone and finding the right capo number, guessing the wrong lyrics with you. One of those moments in the summer when I felt what I felt in the winter.  I miss you so much Vivian, and I'm not trying to fix anything, but rather let you know through these songs and my words how important you have been me to. That I fell truly in love with you and say thank you for all those amazing moments, for loving and being loved back. I'll always be there if you ever need me, and I mean it now just like when I meant it at Tegel before Spain. ETA: I just hope it's not forever. ",
